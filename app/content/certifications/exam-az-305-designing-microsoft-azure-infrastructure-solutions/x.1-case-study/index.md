- Website content must be **easily updated** from a **single point**.
- User input must be minimized when provisioning new app instances.
- Whenever possible, **existing on-premises licenses** should be used to reduce cost.
- Users must always authenticate using their **corp.nadirarfi.com UPN identity**.
- New deployments to **Azure** must be **redundant** in case an **Azure region** fails.
- Solutions should be deployed using **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** wherever possible.
- An **email distribution group** named **IT Support** must be notified of any **directory synchronization** issues.
- Directory synchronization between **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** and **corp.nadirarfi.com** should not be impacted by a **link failure** between Azure and on-premises.

### Database Requirements:
- Database metrics for **WebApp1's production instance** should be available for performance analysis and optimization.
- **Database downtime** during migration should be minimized to avoid disrupting customer access.
- **Database backups** should be retained for a minimum of **seven years** to meet compliance requirements.

### Security Requirements:
- Company information, including policies, templates, and data, should remain inaccessible to anyone outside the company.
- Users on the **on-premises network** must be able to authenticate to **corp.nadirarfi.com** if the **internet link fails**.
- Administrators should be able to authenticate to the **Azure portal** using **corp.nadirarfi.com** credentials.
- All administrative access to the **Azure portal** must be secured with **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- The testing of **WebApp1 updates** must not be visible to anyone outside the company.

## Questions & Answers:

### 1. **What should you include in the identity management strategy to support the planned changes?**
**Options:**
- **A.** Move all the domain controllers from **corp.nadirarfi.com** to virtual networks in Azure.
- **B.** Deploy domain controllers for **corp.nadirarfi.com** to virtual networks in Azure.
- **C.** Deploy a new Azure AD tenant for the authentication of new R&D projects.
- **D.** Deploy domain controllers for the **rd.nadirarfi.com** forest to virtual networks in Azure.

**Answer:**
- **B. Deploy domain controllers for corp.nadirarfi.com to virtual networks in Azure.**

**Explanation:**
Deploying domain controllers for **corp.nadirarfi.com** to Azure allows for **hybrid identity** and **low-latency authentication**. This meets the need to extend the **corporate identity** to Azure, ensuring consistent authentication across cloud and on-premises services. The R&D department will remain on-premises and does not need Azure integration.

### 2. **What should you recommend for migrating the database content of WebApp1 to Azure?**
**Options:**
- **A.** Use Azure Site Recovery to replicate the SQL servers to Azure.
- **B.** Use SQL Server transactional replication.
- **C.** Copy the BACPAC file that contains the Azure SQL database file to Azure Blob storage.
- **D.** Copy the VHD that contains the Azure SQL database files to Azure Blob storage.

**Answer:**
- **C. Copy the BACPAC file that contains the Azure SQL database file to Azure Blob storage.**

**Explanation:**
The **BACPAC** file is the correct way to **migrate** an Azure SQL database as it enables both **database schema** and **data** migration to Azure. This method minimizes downtime and can be used to import the database into **Azure SQL Database**.

### 3. **What is the minimum number of Azure AD tenants needed for Nadirarfi Inc.?**
**Options:**
- **A.** 1
- **B.** 2
- **C.** 3
- **D.** 4

**Answer:**
- **A. 1**

**Explanation:**
Nadirarfi Inc. only needs **1 Azure AD tenant** for managing users, including both **corp.nadirarfi.com** and **Azure AD** identities. There is no need for a second tenant since both corporate identities and Azure-based services can be managed in a **single Azure AD tenant**.

---

### 4. **What should you recommend for the web tier of WebApp1 to minimize resource underutilization during off-peak times?**
**Options:**
- **A.** Create a runbook that resizes virtual machines automatically to a smaller size outside of business hours.
- **B.** Configure the Scale Up settings for a web app.
- **C.** Deploy a virtual machine scale set that scales out on a 75 percent CPU threshold.
- **D.** Configure the Scale Out settings for a web app.

**Answer:**
- **D. Configure the Scale Out settings for a web app.**

**Explanation:**
Scaling out allows Azure to automatically **add instances of the web app** to handle **increased traffic** during peak times. This prevents **underutilization** of resources when traffic is low and ensures that resources are allocated efficiently.
